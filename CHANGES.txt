Next Release

 - Our Mad_Model_ConnectionAdapter package has been expanded and
   moved into the Horde Project as Horde_Db.  We now bundle Horde_Db 
   and support more databases.

 - Removed dependency on Solar_Json.  JSON functionality now only works
   if PHP's JSON extension is enabled.  If it is not enabled and a 
   framework function needing it is called, an exception will be thrown. 
   A workaround for older PHP versions is to define the global functions 
   json_encode() and json_decode().
